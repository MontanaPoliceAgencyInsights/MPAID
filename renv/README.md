# project-paf-515-team-00

## Welcome to the PAF 515 Group 4 Renv file!

This folder contains universal settings that we used to create this project. This includes:

- gitignore
- renv.lock

The gitignore file includes variables that we specifically excluded so that our results are cleaner, and our passwords are hidden
The renv.lock file includes all all packages that are needed to be installed so that you may recreate our results!
**IMPORTANT**
Use "renv::restore()" to to download the specific versions of the packages used during our project. This is important, because some of these packages may have updated since we created this project!
In fact, some of the packages updated *during* the semester, as we created this project! Which was a lot of fun to navigate!
