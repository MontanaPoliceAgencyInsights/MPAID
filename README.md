## Welcome to the PAF 515 Github Repository!

To get started, explore the [Project Rubric](https://watts-college.github.io/cpp-528-template/project/project_rubric.html) for an overview of the final project and the [Project Rubric Guide](https://r-class.github.io/cpp-528-example-repo/Final-Project-Guide.html) for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to create your project's website.

This repository was originally provided by Professor Stowers (Watts College of Arizona State University) for PAF 515 Spring 2025 to serve as the repository for Team 4 final project website. Contributors to this project include Kenaniah Dodson, Michelle Knopp, and Drew Radovich. We explored whether or not the New Markets Tax Credits and the Low Income Housing Tax Credits had an effect on Social Vulnerability and economic outcomes within U.S. communities between 2010 and 2020. We looked at 3 divisions, the Mountain Division, the Pacific Division, and the South Atlantic Division.
